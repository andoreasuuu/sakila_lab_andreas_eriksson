# sakila_lab_andreas_eriksson

This project explores the Sakila DVD rental database using SQL queries executed with DuckDB inside a Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to ingest the SQLite database into DuckDB, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualize key business insights.

Task 0 – Ingest Sakila (SQLite → DuckDB)
In this task, the original SQLite Sakila database was loaded into a local DuckDB file. All tables were successfully copied, and quick checks confirmed that the data was imported correctly. This created the foundation for all later analysis.

Task 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
A series of SQL queries were used to explore the Sakila dataset, including film lengths, keyword searches, actor participation, customer spending, and revenue by category. The goal was to understand patterns and trends across films, customers, actors, and rentals. Five additional custom questions were also created to extend the analysis.

Task 2 – Visualizations
Matplotlib was used to create clear and meaningful charts based on selected results from the analysis. These include spending for top customers and revenue by film category. The visualizations help highlight key business insights in a more intuitive and readable format.

> The idea is to make someone immediately understand what the lab is about and be interested to learn more.
